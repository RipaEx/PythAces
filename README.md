# Python ACES adaptation

## Installation

```sh
install and sync relay server
git clone https://github.com/galperins4/PythAces 
cd ~/PythAces/config
update configs (see below)
cd ~/PythAces
bash install_beta.sh
```

## Configuration & Usage 

After the repository has been cloned you need to open the `coin.json` and change it to your liking. Once this has been done execute the pm2 command `pm2 start apps.json`to start the script. 

As the script leverages @FaustBrians ARK python client as well as database retreival and storage classes, python 3.6+ is required. In addition a relay node of the channel coin is required.

## Available Channel Configuration Options (coin.json)
- channel: dpos channel for inbound transactions (currently support ark/dark, kapu/dkapu, persona-t)
- channel_ip: ip address of node
- service_acct: service account for inbound transactions for the channel 
- db_username: os username
- flat_fee: flat fee per transaction
- pct_fee: percentage fee per transaction
- reach: how many peers to broadcast tx to (NOT CURRENTLY IN USE)

## Available Coin Configuration Options (coin.json) - per coin supported 
- relay_ip: relay to broadcast outbound transactions
- service_acct: outbound service account 
- service_account_passphrase: passphrase 
- service_account_secondphrase: secondphrase 
- addr_start: letter addresses start with

Note: Pythaces runs on port 5000
